This is an example of a post which includes a feature image specified in the front matter of the post. The feature image spans the full-width of the page, and is shown with the title on permalink pages.

I guess my case study goes here ... but let me make sure whats what first!!!

{% highlight javascript %}
myApp.directive('myDirective', function() {
    return {
        templateUrl: 'templates/mydirective.html',
        replace: true,
        restrict: 'E'
    };
});
{% endhighlight %}
