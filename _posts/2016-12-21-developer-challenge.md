title: The biggest challenge I faced when learning to develop
---
When I first started to learn programing, either by teaching myself, and/or here at Bloc my biggest issue was always with remembering all the various commands, functions, methods and syntax. I thought I’d never be able to do it. But I was wrong.

The biggest challenge I and everybody else has when learning programing is to think like a programmer. To be able to process and requirements of a problem and be able to solve it before writing a single line of code. I know this statement by itself maybe challenging for some who want to learn “programing”! After all this is what you’re aiming at, right?
 
My mentor at Bloc explained it to me in a way that made a whole lot of sense. He said, most people want to jump in and start writing code, but that’s the wrong way of going about it. After all the quantity of information we learn as starters is immense and there’s no way that we can, or will, remember all or even some of it to write a simple function. He said, if you solve the problem in English first, then putting the code together becomes significantly easier and eventually as time passes muscle memory kicks in and you’ll be able to write code. 
 
That couldn’t be truer. Thinking like a programmer is actually a pretty tough challenge. It is my biggest challenge anyway! But I’m working on it and I can say, it does make a huge difference when I had need to write a function that tickled my brain quite a bit. It took me literally a couple of days to solve the problem, but only about a couple of minutes to put a set of code together that began to resolve the problem and provide the desired outcome. 
 
Solving the problem in English takes many forms. I, for instance, talk to my computer or the wall sometimes in an effort to process the information I have and how I can get to the ultimate outcome. Its really not an easy proposition, and may appear strange to an onlooker, but when done properly, the results are pretty good.
 
I’m learning how to think like a developer and I can say I fell like I can do this now!!!
