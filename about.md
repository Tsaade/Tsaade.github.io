Well, a bit about me.

I'm a web developer in the making now and I'm as novice as they come! but I'm working on it!

I started out in the IT industry as QA engineer. Worked in this field for about 12 years before I felt the need to change. I moved overseas and woed in finance and cost control for about 6 years. I returned to the U.S. in 2010. I wanted to continue in that field, but unfortunately I wasn't too successful at that. I dabled in a number of things attempting to make ends meet and develop something out of nothing to no avail!

One day, I stumblled onto an advertizement to learn coding. I thought hmm, why not?! The result was joining Bloc. And here I am tellin gyou about myself in an about page on what will develop to become my portfolio.

One day, I plan to become very very good at this.

wich me luck -:)
